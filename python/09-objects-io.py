########## Reading from a file ##########

########## Intro to Exception handling ##########


#When working with files (or doing anything in programming),
#Exceptions can be thrown

#file = open("doesntexist.csv", "r") #get wrecked son

except Exception as e:
    print(type(e))
    print(e)

try:
    file = open("input.txt", "r") #Make sure it exists
    data = int(file.read()) #This should fail
except FileNotFoundError as e: #subclass of OSError
    print("This file is not found")
except OSError as e:
    print("Couldn't open file")
except PermissionError as e:
    print("file is locked")
except ValueError as e:
    print("Cannot parse data. Check file") 
except Exception as e:
    print(type(e))
    print(e)
finally:
    file.close()
    print("Always runs")
